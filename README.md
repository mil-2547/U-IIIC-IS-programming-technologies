The lab work on Terraform, GitHub Actions, and AWS is dedicated to mastering modern Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and CI/CD workflows for cloud deployment. We will use Terraform to define and provision necessary AWS infrastructure (such as VPCs, EC2 instances, or S3 buckets) in a declarative manner. The primary focus will be integrating this provisioning process with GitHub Actions to create an automated, trigger-based pipeline. This pipeline will execute Terraform plans and applies directly upon code pushes, allowing students to achieve reliable, version-controlled, and fully automated cloud resource management, demonstrating key practices of robust and scalable DevOps automation.
