# U-IIIC-IS-programming-technologies
Laboratory work on software testing (ST) is aimed at acquiring practical skills in the field of software quality assurance. We will develop a test plan, create test cases based on requirements specifications, and perform various types of testing (such as functional, unit, or integration testing) to detect defects (bugs). The goal is to learn how to systematically approach the testing process, document found errors, track their resolution, and assess the overall quality of the tested software product using standard testing methodologies and tools.
