The laboratory work on Jenkins focuses on acquiring practical skills in Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) using this leading open-source automation server. We will learn to install and configure a Jenkins instance, manage plugins, and set up build pipelines that automatically fetch source code from a repository (e.g., Git), compile the application, run automated tests, and generate build artifacts.  The primary goal is to master the creation of end-to-end automation workflows that ensure frequent and reliable integration of code changes, allowing for rapid detection of errors and paving the way for efficient DevOps practices and automated deployment.
